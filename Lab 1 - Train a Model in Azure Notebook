# Lab 1 - Train a Model in Azure Notebook

## Lab 1.0: Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Use Azure Notebook with Python, a cloud based Jupyter Notebook service.
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Create machine learning model features
- Train an open source based classification predictive model.

The main goal of this lab is to get students up to speed using Azure Notebooks while getting them started on the Adventure Works use case.

## Introduction

You're going to train a classification model in an Azure Notebook using Python and the open source package scikit-learn. As part of that you will need to perform some basic exploratory data analysis to understand the data.  Then you will need to create features to be used in model training. Finally, you will train and evaluate your model. Note:  At this point, you will not be using Azure services. 

Your team's data engineer has provided you with a data extract file in CSV format that has all the data you need.  The starter lab notebook will guide you through the tasks you need to perform for this lab. 



## Lab 1: Resources

You will use the following files from the lab folder:

Name                            | Description
----                            | -----------
Starter_Lab1_Notebook.ipynb     | The lab notebook you should use.  Import this into your Notebook project and open it. 
AWData.csv                      | Adventure Works data extract file. Upload this file to your Azure Notebook project.
